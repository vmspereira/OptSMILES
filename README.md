# OptSMILES

Inspired in [AutoGrow4](https://durrantlab.pitt.edu/autogrow4/), the framework uses in silico RDKit reactions to mutate compounds. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm explores these mutations to optimize the compounds. Besides generic optimization goals, such as the *logP*, OptSmiles also includes a bitter classifier.
